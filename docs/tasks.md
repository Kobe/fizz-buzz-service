# Fizz Buzz Service Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Fizz Buzz Service. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality and Organization

1. [ ] Fix the FizzBuzzCalculationService logic to check for divisibility by 15 before checking for divisibility by 3 or 5
2. [ ] Move the FizzBuzzResponse sealed class to its own file to follow the single responsibility principle
3. [ ] Resolve the TODO in FizzBuzzRepositoryIT regarding entityManager.persist not working
4. [ ] Add proper exception handling in the WorldClockClient with specific error types
5. [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all controllers with a global exception handler
6. [ ] Add input validation for the FizzBuzz endpoint to handle edge cases (e.g., very large numbers)
7. [ ] Refactor the FizzBuzzService to use non-blocking reactive programming consistently
8. [ ] Add proper logging throughout the application using SLF4J
9. [ ] Implement code style checks using ktlint or detekt

## Architecture and Design Patterns

10. [ ] Restructure the application to follow a cleaner layered architecture (controller, service, repository)
11. [ ] Implement the circuit breaker pattern for the WorldClockClient using Resilience4j
12. [ ] Add a caching layer for frequently accessed FizzBuzz results
13. [ ] Implement a proper domain model with value objects and entities
14. [ ] Use dependency injection more consistently with constructor injection
15. [ ] Implement the repository pattern more thoroughly with custom query methods
16. [ ] Add a service interface layer to improve testability and maintainability
17. [ ] Consider implementing CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations

## Testing

18. [ ] Improve test coverage for FizzBuzzService to include error scenarios
19. [ ] Add tests for the MainController
20. [ ] Implement property-based testing for the FizzBuzzCalculationService
21. [ ] Add integration tests for database operations with test containers
22. [ ] Implement contract tests for the WorldClockClient using Spring Cloud Contract
23. [ ] Add load tests using JMeter or Gatling
24. [ ] Implement mutation testing to verify test quality
25. [ ] Add end-to-end tests using Selenium or Cypress

## Documentation

26. [ ] Enhance API documentation with detailed descriptions, examples, and response schemas
27. [ ] Create a comprehensive README with architecture diagrams and design decisions
28. [ ] Document the FizzBuzz algorithm and business rules
29. [ ] Add KDoc comments to all public classes and methods
30. [ ] Create a developer guide with setup instructions and contribution guidelines
31. [ ] Document the database schema and relationships
32. [ ] Add a changelog to track version changes

## Performance and Scalability

33. [ ] Replace the in-memory H2 database with a production-ready database like PostgreSQL
34. [ ] Implement database connection pooling for better performance
35. [ ] Add caching for the WorldClockClient responses
36. [ ] Implement pagination for the endpoint that returns all FizzBuzz results
37. [ ] Add rate limiting for the API endpoints
38. [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
39. [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations

## Security

40. [ ] Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security
41. [ ] Disable the H2 console in production environments
42. [ ] Add HTTPS support with proper certificate management
43. [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
44. [ ] Add CORS configuration for web clients
45. [ ] Implement API key authentication for external clients
46. [ ] Add security headers to HTTP responses
47. [ ] Implement audit logging for security-relevant events

## DevOps and CI/CD

48. [ ] Create a Dockerfile for containerization
49. [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local development
50. [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration (dev, test, prod)
51. [ ] Enhance GitHub Actions workflows with more comprehensive testing
52. [ ] Add static code analysis to the CI pipeline
53. [ ] Implement automated deployment to staging and production environments
54. [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting using Prometheus and Grafana
55. [ ] Implement log aggregation using ELK stack or similar
56. [ ] Add health checks and readiness probes for Kubernetes deployment
57. [ ] Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform or similar

## Feature Enhancements

58. [ ] Add support for custom FizzBuzz rules
59. [ ] Implement a statistics endpoint to show most frequently requested numbers
60. [ ] Add a batch processing endpoint for multiple FizzBuzz calculations
61. [ ] Implement a WebSocket endpoint for real-time FizzBuzz calculations
62. [ ] Add support for different output formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
63. [ ] Implement a simple web UI for interacting with the API
64. [ ] Add internationalization support for error messages
65. [ ] Implement a feature toggle system for gradual rollout of new features
